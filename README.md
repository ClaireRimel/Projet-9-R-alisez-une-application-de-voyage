# Projet-9-RÃ©alisez-une-application-de-voyage

On this 9th project, I had to realize an application for travelers.

It offers several services such as currency conversion (US dollar), the weather in the city of Nantes as well of New York and the translation of texts in English.

This application is available on iPhone (from iOS 11.0) in portrait, landscape and is tested with unit tests.

To do this activity, I mainly got information from [OpenClassrooms](https://openclassrooms.com/fr/courses/4504841-gerez-la-navigation-et-les-formulaires-en-ios), and I received advices from my mentor of OpenClassroom and also from my partner, who is himself an iOS developper.
